# readable-code


This project is to create more readable and understandable code without changing the functionality of the webpage.
No installation PHP codesniffer at this point so we will do it manually to have a better glance.

We will correct and take a look at the following steps ;

1-Check for Indentation 

* Check if the placing of the curly brackets are where they should be, like that they are easy to understand on each line.
* Use nesting and spacing for functions and use them on the right level.

It can be personal to give some spaces after functions however in most cases the intention is to make the reading easier for everyone.

2- Check for Variable & Function Names

* For later use and also for better understanding in group projects, it is essential to name variables and functions logically.
* Shortages for functions & variable names should also be meaninful and not too short! 
* Rewrite the names that are very short which doesn't make any sense to anyone.It is to avoid struggling to explain variables and functions in later stage what they actually do.
* Change if condition to switch to make readibilty better.
* Remove unnecessary functions and variables.



3- Unified code
* Changed double quote notations to single quote to give a unified code.
